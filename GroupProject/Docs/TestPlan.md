## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

The levels of testing listed below will be performed in order during the testing of the application:

Unit Testing: As the first phase of the testing unit testing will be performed. In this step, the small pieces of testable code, individual functions will be executed. Each unit function in the application will have a purpose to pass. The unit testing will be performed by developers. <br> <br>
Integration Testing: The different modules of the application that are integrated will be tested as a group. The goal of integration testing is finding defects between modules during the interaction. The integration testing will be performed by testers. <br> <br>
System Testing: The fully integrated application will be tested as a whole system. The system testing will be performed after integration testing. This phase of testing will be performed by testers. <br> <br>
Acceptance Testing: The last phase of testing will be the acceptance testing. In this step, the product will be operated by users to validate the software and will be decided if the product is ready for the release. Any bug found in this phase will be documented and once all bugs are fixed, the product will be ready for the release. The last step of testing will be performed by end users. <br> <br>

### 1.2 Test Selection
We will use both black-box and white-box techniques to select test cases.

In black-box testing, we assume that software is a closed box. We donâ€™t look at the details of the code. The focus in black-box testing is just input and output of the software application based on the requirements. White-box testing is the opposite of the black-box testing. The purpose of white-box testing is to evaluate the structure of code in the application.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

We are going to assess the quality of the unit, integration testing with JUnit and the code coverage of the IDE tool will be used to ensure the quality. The system level testing will be assessed by the analysis of integration testing steps to make sure all conditions are met. The acceptance testing quality will be performed.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking
The bugs will be documented by using the Issues page of the team repository on GitHub.

### 1.5 Technology
During the test phases, our intention to use JUnit for unit testing, Appium tool to automate the testing cycle.
