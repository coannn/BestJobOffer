# Project Plan

**Author**: \<team 134\>

## 1 Intro

This application is a job comparison tool where the user enters all job offers and job offer details as well as the weightage attributed to each job offer component and receives a final ranking of job offers. 

## 2 Process Description

Inception 
In this inception phase, we create the general vision for the project. We collect the key requirements and features of the application as well as the main constraints. We also create an initial project plan and decide the scope and schedule of the project implementation. We also outline the development process during this phase. 
Entrace Criteria: We will need the list of requirements that the project demands. We will also need the resources necessary to work on the project.
Exit Criteria: This phase will result in a project plan, use case models and a UML diagram outlining the core functionality of the application. And it can result in any prototype that was developed. This phase is complete once the documents outlined are complete. 

Elaboration 
In this elaboration phase, we will analyze the problem domain, establish the complete architecture of the application, eliminate high risk elements by addressing the most critical use cases, and continue to refine the overall plan and schedule of the project. The main goal in this phase is to work towards a stable architecture and gain confidence that the developed architecture can be accomplished with the resources available.  
Entrance Criteria: We will need the preliminary use case models, the UML diagram, project requirements, project plan. 
Exit Criteria: We will produce an almost complete use-case model, and a supplemental requirements document. We will also produce a complete software architecture document and a comprehensive test plan that will later be used as a benchmark for application performance. We will also produce prototypes in the form of user interface designs and will continue to refine our project plan document. This phase is complete once the documents outlined are complete. 

Construction 
In this phase, we plan to implement all of the planned features in the project, and thoroughly test all the features using the test plan from the previous phase. We will make sure that all the use cases are met and that the test results match our expectations. The main goal of this phase is to develop the code for the project and make sure the code is stable. 
Entrance Criteria: We will need a complete software architecture, test plan, complete use-case model 
Exit Criteria: We will produce stable code but may not be the final code. We will also produce the test results from the execution of our test plan. We will also produce a user manual for the application. We will continue to revise the project plan based on the progress made.  This phase is complete once code is stable and we have initial test results. 

Transition
In this phase, we will continue to refine the code and make sure we have a final product ready to deploy. We will make sure all of our previous documentation(architecture, use case etc.) are updated to reflect the final project. We will make sure our testing is complete and all of our test cases are passing.
Entrance Criteria: All the previous project related documents as well as the code produced in the previous phase. 
Exit Criteria: Final product, refined project documents, final test results.  This phase is complete once code is deployed with all testing complete.
